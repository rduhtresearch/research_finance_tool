Cost splits rules engine notes:
For each ICT activity row, the rules engine calculates all postings from the Activity Cost after applying the Market Forces Factor (MFF). The first step is to calculate the Direct amount, which equals Activity Cost × MFF. This represents the core payment for delivering the activity and is posted to the department or organisation delivering the work. Capacity and Indirect are then calculated as additional uplifts from the same base cost. Capacity is 20% of the Activity Cost, multiplied by MFF, and is always posted to R&D (50000). Indirect is 70% of the Activity Cost, multiplied by MFF, and is then split into three parts: 50% to the delivery organisation (for example 50007, CRF, UoE or DPT depending on scenario), 25% to Trust overhead, and 25% to PI capacity. Direct, Capacity and Indirect are all calculated independently from the same base cost and do not reduce one another. Investigations follow the same calculation structure; the Direct portion is simply routed to the providing department (e.g. Pathology or Imaging) while Capacity and Indirect are calculated and split in the same way. There are special cases where the distribution of the Direct portion differs, such as Trust Research Doctor (TRD) trials where medic costs are split 40% to the PI’s employing department and 60% to the clinical delivery team cost centre before the standard Capacity and Indirect uplifts are applied. Other override scenarios (e.g. facility charges, monitoring visits, training fees or push payments) adjust the destination of the Direct portion but do not change the underlying 20% Capacity and 70% Indirect uplift calculations.

The method works because every allocation is calculated from the same consistent base value: Activity Cost × MFF. Capacity (20%) and Indirect (70%) are applied as fixed uplifts from that base, and Indirect is fully allocated because its internal split (50% + 25% + 25%) equals 100%. Since all percentages are constant and proportional, the model scales linearly — if the activity cost changes, every component changes in the same ratio — ensuring predictable, balanced and fully reconciled outputs.
